=======
## Overview
<!-- Provide a general overview of the daily concepts and processes that will be covered in lectures and labs -->

Databases power web applications everywhere by enabling them to persist, modify, and query datasets to great effect. While there are many types of database options available now, Structured Query Language (SQL) remains the de facto standard for communicating with relational database systems. Let's build some SQL skills!

- View today's and tomorrow's classes and labs as a big two-part structure. It's all the same basic subject, but way too much for one day, so we've split it.
- Reminder: There is **NO** portfolio assignment associated with today, so that means you can set that aside briefly (other than getting caught up...), and tomorrow's portfolio assignment is another peer review that's you'll do with your assigned lab partner for Friday.

## Daily Plan

- Code Review
- Installation of Postgres progress?
- Be aware that the setup and initialization challenges with the first run of a Postgres environment are often shared by individuals with the same operating systems. It's a good idea to gather in those tribes and share those details when getting started with today's lab.
- We'll plan to do a big review of the lab code in the third segment class today. Sam won't publish the lab until we are finished with class; you should be 100% dialed on the class discussion and not futzing around on your own screen, other than to take some notes.

**Slides on SQL**

- A little bit of a REST reminder to start off

- CRUD
	- Databases as a resource
	- C = CREATE
	- R = READ
	- U = UPDATE
	- D = DESTROY (or DELETE)

- Relational Databases
	- Discuss differences between document based storage
	- Discuss common DBMS - MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite, etc
	- Discuss concepts of relational data

- SQL
	- Syntax
	- Statements
	- Clauses
	- Constraints
	- Expressions
	- Predicates
	- [SQL cheat sheet](http://www.cheat-sheets.org/sites/sql.su/)

- Data types
	- INTEGER

## Learning Objectives
<!--
ABCD:
  Audience: Program participants
  Behavior: Expected learning/behavior changes/results
  Condition:
    Circumstances that lead to change/result
    When change/result are expected to occur
  Degree: How much change occurs (%) for how many participants (#)
-->

* Understand the basic concepts of databases

* Effectively use basic SQL commands to create, read, update, and delete rows from a table

* Understand the fundamental architecture of full-stack applications and how we can locally emulate them
