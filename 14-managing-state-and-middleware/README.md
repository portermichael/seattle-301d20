=======
## Overview

*The focus of this class will be the underlying concepts of middleware and how to manage application state, through the use of a routing framework (PageJS).*

## Daily Plan

- Project samples! Here's a couple more!
	- [Baby Safe](http://baby-safe.herokuapp.com/)
	- [Seattle Field Finder](https://field-finder.herokuapp.com/)

- Projects! Project teams! Let's talk about some basic calendar stuff for the coming days.

- Reminder: the entrance exam for the 401 courses (which doubles as the final exam for this course) will be published Friday afternoon and be available until 11:59pm Sunday. It is a graded portion of this course, regardless of your intent to advance to a 401 course.

- To help you prepare for that, there will be an extra non-graded quiz published in Canvas tomorrow. It will give you a little more practice to get ready for the types of questions on the exam.
- Per Code Fellows policy, there will be a blackout on completing coursework during Project Week. You should have all of your lingering unfinished coursework submitted by no later than Tuesday morning at 8:59am.
- If you need more time after that, discuss a plan for that with Sam and/or our Admissions team. Also be aware of how your work progress and grades overlap with admissions requirements and deadlines for upcoming 401 courses. Enrollments are running high and we are already establishing waitlists for upcoming 401s.

- If you'd like to schedule a one-on-one meeting with Sam in the coming days, please select one of the slots available at [this link](https://sam-301d20.youcanbook.me/). Today's one-on-ones, held in one of the little glass offices in the catacombs:
	- 2:00 Ryan
	- 2:15 Oscar
	- 3:00 Alexis
	- 3:15 Kyle
	- 3:30 TJay
	- 3:45 Megan
