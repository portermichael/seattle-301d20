# Class 20 -  Project Week: Milestone 5

***Presentation day! Generally speaking, project presentations should take no more than 15-20 minutes each, including questions. This can be adjusted based on time constraints or class size, especially if other classes are presenting on the same day.***

## Presentation Day

* Be mindful of the presentation schedule, when your team presents, and go see as many other presentations as you can if there are other classes presenting that day.

* Your presentations should take approximately **15 minutes**.â€¨

* Have one team member track time, and help keep things moving forward.

* Expect and be ready to answer questions at the end of your presentation.

* Have fun!!

* Remember to submit all Canvas assignments (such as the post-presentation report) by their deadlines.

## Grading
Your grade is based on your individual effort and your project's technical merit.

* Individual effort is graded based on **links to commits and Pull Requests** that demonstrate your contributions.
* Technical merit is graded based on the following
 criteria:

* **MVC/REST architecture**
    * Single-page app style
    * Clearly defined Resources in the app
    * The app utilizes persistence to preserve state through a page refresh
    * The app manages state appropriately vis the use of PageJS routing middleware
    * Resources have well-factored and isolated M, V, C components
    * URLs use conventional REST design and provide a useful API for the end user

* **Good and proper use of HTML**
    * Clear, readable, and efficient structure
    * Use semantic markup whenever possible
    * Projects **must** utilize [Open Graph meta tags](http://ogp.me/) so that the applications provide rich previews in social media and messaging applications.

* **Good and proper use of CSS**
    * Clear, readable, and efficient styles
    * Layout on various screen sizes like desktop and mobile
    * Well organized file structure following SMACSS concepts.

* **Good and proper use of JavaScript**
    * Clear, readable, and efficient code
    * Uses domain models to encapsulate data and behavior (OOP)
    * Responds to user events and inputs
    * Leverages AJAX appropriately in at least one case to interact with an external API
    * Integrates 3rd party libraries like jQuery consistently and appropriately
    * Contains no unnecessary or commented-out code *(no corpse code!)*

* **Generally useful and functional**
    * Works as expected with no bugs
    * Has at least 3 interlinked "pages" with a clear navigation
    * Has at least two pages that accept and process user input
    * State is persisted between page reloads
    * Deployed live on the Internet with a meaningfully-named URL, either through a custom-named Heroku (or similar service) application or, ideally, through purchasing and connecting a domain (as of April 2017, Namecheap.com offers a wide variety of domain names for $0.88).
    * Final presentation is done from the live deployed app, not *"that version on someones laptop that works better"*, so that audience members can try out your app if they like

## Congratulations!
Thanks for all your hard work through this course! We can't wait to see where you go with your new super powers. :)
