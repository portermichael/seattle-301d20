![CF](https://i.imgur.com/7v5ASc8.png)  Class 10: Functional Programming
=======
## Overview
<!-- Provide a general overview of the daily concepts and processes that will be covered in lectures and labs -->

The focus of this class is on basic functional programming concepts, through the use of the following array methods: `.forEach()`, `.map()`, `.filter()`, and `.reduce()`.

## Daily Plan

It's a ***BIG*** day on campus, lots going on, and we'll adapt our schedule accordingly:

- **9:00-10:15ish:** Part 1 of lecture
- **10:30ish-11:45:** Part 2 of lecture after a 15-minute break
- **11:45-12:15:** break
- **12:15-1:00:** Partner Power Hour: Deconstructing Behavioral Questions & Business Fundamentals with CF grad Hugo Guerra
- **1:00:** lab starts
- **1:15ish:** Part 2 of of the joint iOS 401 and JS 401 presentations (Part 1 is during the morning while we are in lecture). You are free to go watch (*those rolling into the next JS course probably* ***should*** *go watch, as this is the 5-week point for the current JS cohort*), rather than immediately dive into your lab assignment that will be due on Monday morning.

- **Week In Review, and What Lies Ahead**

- **Code Review**

`15 minute break`

*"Sometimes, the elegant implementation is just a function.  Not a method.  Not a class.  Not a framework.  Just a function."* - [John Carmack](https://twitter.com/id_aa_carmack/status/53512300451201024)

## Learning Objectives
<!--
ABCD:
  Audience: Program participants
  Behavior: Expected learning/behavior changes/results
  Condition:
    Circumstances that lead to change/result
    When change/result are expected to occur
  Degree: How much change occurs (%) for how many participants (#)
-->

* Understand advantages of functional programming and reasons for its recent rise in popularity
* Correctly use **.forEach(), .map(), .filter(), .reduce()** array methods to explore a data set
* Construct modularity with IIFE patterns
